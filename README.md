#### About All in One TFT LCD Displays

Winstar [M Series](https://www.winstar.com.tw/products/tft-lcd/clever-system-tft.html) TFT Displays which we called "Clever System - All in one TFT Display" is an easy access system for users to begin exploring the colorful display on their applications. The M Series Modules are "all in one system" which has 2 user interfaces including UART and SPI interfaces; it supports backlight brightness adjust, PMW signal output and 4 switches button sensor. Winstar Display has already designed a TFT editing program for end users to design their software more easily.

- All in One System: We build the micro controller behind the TFT panel, it can driver TFT, backlight and touch panel directly. The M Series modules also have microcontrollers (PIC24), SRAM (frame buffer) and flash storage (graphic files).
- Convenient to Upgrade: The software can be upgraded on line to download the new version; therefore, the customers don't need to upgrade via burning machine.
- Less Coding Process: Programming and test of these modes can be done by our software "user interface" (UI). Winstar's UI program can demo what you want; so users don't need to write any software.
- Reduce I/O Port: The customers can use UART or SPI-4 Line to driver TFT directly. A suitable USB adapter is also included in the scope of supply.
Winstar designs an optional development board which Part no. is WWTFT-10# for customers to accelerate the project for test function.
